# Preflight: Pass/Fail Checks Before Delivery

Why none of this is a verdict: commercial AI detectors, built on the same signals this checklist uses, have shown false-positive rates above 60% on non-native English writers (Liang et al., Stanford, 2023). Report patterns; never assert authorship.

Run after every rewrite or edit, before returning the draft. Answer each check pass or fail. Any fail means fix the draft first. For detect requests, verify the response names each pattern with a quoted line and a short fix, without rewriting, scoring, or claiming AI authorship.

## Fidelity and no-fabrication

1. Does the edit preserve the writer's point without adding claims, examples, stats, quotes, names, dates, or opinions that weren't in the source or supplied by the author?
2. Are any citations left in the text real and relevant to the claims they support, with fake or unrelated ones flagged?
3. Where a specific was needed but unavailable, is there a clear flag or question to the author instead of an invented detail?
3a. Did every concrete detail in the source survive the edit (numbers, names, dates, mechanisms) rather than being smoothed into generic importance?
3b. Was substance preserved rather than simplified away: nuance, technical precision, and the author's actual position all intact?

## Voice

4. Does it keep what only this writer would have produced: their diction, angle, bluntness, humor, stated uncertainty, and the digressions that carry character?
5. Were strong human sentences left alone instead of rewritten for consistency or tidiness?
6. Was the writer's habit cut rather than protected: throat-clearing, hedges, filler transitions, redundant setup, generic emphasis, the sentence that restates the previous one? Being in the author's draft is not a reason to keep something.
7. Apply the signature test to anything preserved: could another competent writer have produced it on autopilot? If yes and it adds nothing, it should have been cut.
8. Would the writer recognize the result as their own voice, with more of it per paragraph than before?

## Structure and rhythm

9. Does the draft lead with what the reader needs while keeping personal setup that adds context, tension, or character?
9a. Does every unit a reader navigates by front-load its point (draft, section, paragraph) except where a narrative or persuasive setup earns the delay? Not sentences: rule 13 stops at the paragraph on purpose, and front-loading every sentence rebuilds the one-thought-per-sentence profile rule 9 exists to undo.
9b. If the structure was reorganized, is the reason stated in the What changed summary?
10. Does it avoid robotic symmetry: repeated sentence shapes, uniform paragraph sizes, stacked punchy fragments?
11. Are tangled sentences fixed while clear spoken cadence, fragments, and pace changes remain intact?
11a. Was it treated as the right kind of writing: an answer that states its point and stops, or a deliverable whose length is the substance?
11b. Would the reader act wrongly because something was cut? Silent omission outranks every length rule here.
12. Does the piece end on a concrete point, takeaway, or next action, with summary-recap endings and fake-profound kicker lines deleted (not rewritten into better metaphors)?

## Pattern removal

13. Are Tier 1 vocabulary, filler phrases, hollow intensifiers, and inflated claims gone (unless quoted as examples)?
14. Are binary contrasts, affirmative reversals (setup-then-deflation with no negation), negative listings, colon reveals, throat-clearing, faux-insight setups, and dramatic fragments removed?
15. Are importance puffery and weasel attribution replaced with plain facts and named sources, or flagged to the author when no source exists?
15a. Is every relationship named rather than gestured at ("is associated with," "in connection with," "has ties to"), or flagged where the specifics aren't known?
15b. Any assertion of realness doing emphasis work ("the gap is real," "genuine utility") without a named contrast?
16. Is formatting slop gone: emoji headings, decorative bold, bullets that should be prose, headers over tiny sections, Title Case subheadings?

## Mechanical scans

**Before working through this list, run `../scripts/prose-scan.py <file>`.** Checks 13 and 16 through 19 are arithmetic, and it does them exactly in about a second. What is left is the part that needs a reader.

17. Dash scan: does a search for `—`, `–`, and `--` come back clean (at most one per 1,000 words, with en dashes in numeric ranges exempt), unless the writer's own voice sample uses them?
18. Artifact scan: no chatbot phrases, placeholders, leaked citation tokens, AI-tool URL parameters, cutoff disclaimers, or invisible characters anywhere?
19. Enough text to judge? Under roughly forty words, report that the sample is too short instead of returning a verdict.

## Final read

20. Self-audit: reading the draft fresh, what would make it look obviously AI-generated? (Fix whatever the answer is.)
21. Would the draft sound natural read aloud to a sharp colleague?
22. Does the output include what the mode requires (issues found, rewrite, what changed, second-pass audit for rewrite mode; edits + verification for edit mode)?
