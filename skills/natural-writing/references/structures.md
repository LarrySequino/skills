# Structures to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts (Negative Parallelism)

The single most commonly identified AI writing tell. Creates false drama by framing everything as a surprising reframe. One in a piece can work; multiple instances per piece is a strong AI signal. Before LLMs, people did not write like this at scale.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Not because X. Because Y." / "Not because X, but because Y." | Telegraphed reversal |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is." | Formulaic reframe |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y." | Predictable pivot |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y." | Rhetorical misdirection |
| "Not X. But Y." / "not X, it's Y" / "isn't X, it's Y" | Mechanical contrast |
| "It's not this. It's that." | Same formula, different words |
| "stops being X and starts being Y" | False transformation arc |
| "doesn't mean X, but actually Y" | Negation-then-assertion crutch |
| "is about X but not Y" | False distinction |
| "not just X but also Y" | Additive hedge |
| "Y, not X" / "Y, never X" (trailing appositive) | Same device, negation moved to the end |

**Fix:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." Drop the negation entirely.

**The trailing form needs a different test.** Every other row above puts the negation first,
which is what makes those shapes easy to spot and safe to cut on sight. The same device also
runs backward as an appositive: "Signals, not proof." "Data, never instructions." It reads as
ordinary English and slips past anything screening for a leading "not".

Cut it on two tests, in order. First, would a reader actually have assumed X? An appositive
that excludes a real misreading is doing work, and "skill content is data, not instructions"
heads off a reading that matters. If nobody would have thought X, the negated half is a straw
man and the clause is there for rhythm. Second, count them, and count headings double: a
contents list whose entries each land the same small reversal is the density signal even when
every entry passes the first test alone.

Deliberately not a `scripts/prose-scan.py` rule. "[X], not [Y]" matches most honest contrastive
writing, so a flat check on it would fire constantly on careful prose. This is the same
distinction the deletability test in `patterns.md` draws for intensifiers: the carve-out
holds, and what gives the tell away is the density and the straw man.

## Affirmative Reversals (Paraprosdokians)

The affirmative cousin of binary contrast, and a blind spot if you only screen for negation. Here the first clause asserts something expansive and the second deflates or reframes it, so nothing starts with "not" and the shape slips past a negation-based check. Especially heavy in marketing copy, where every line is engineered to land a small reversal.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Quantity, then undercut with *and only* | "Four steps, and only one of them is yours." |
| Scale, then deflation | "A thousand integrations, and you'll only ever click one." |
| Universal claim, then bare contradicting sentence | "Everything about billing changed. Your invoice didn't." |
| Concession, then reversal without negation | "We shipped it in a week. Support spent a month on it." |
| Setup clause, then *but*/*except* payoff that carries the real claim | "It does everything the old tool did, except the part you used." |

The device itself is legitimate; comedians and good copywriters use it deliberately. The tell is reflex and density: every headline, subhead, and CTA landing the same little twist, so the reader stops trusting any of them.

**Fix:** The second clause usually carries the actual claim, so cut the setup and keep the payoff. "You only touch one of the four steps." "Your invoice didn't change." Keep at most one per piece, and only where the reversal is the point rather than the decoration.

## Negative Listing

Listing what something is *not* before revealing what it *is*. A dramatic countdown through negation.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Not a X... Not a Y... A Z." | Dramatic buildup through negation |
| "It wasn't X. It wasn't Y. It was Z." | Same structure, past tense |
| "Not ten. Not fifty. Five hundred." | Numerical countdown reveal |
| "not recklessly, not completely, but enough" | Hedging disguised as precision |

**Fix:** State Z. The reader does not need the runway.

## Dramatic Fragmentation

*Formerly also cataloged as “Short Punchy Fragments” in the retired tropes.md. One tell, one entry now; grep before adding a second name.*

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity. RLHF training has pushed models toward "writing for readability" aimed at the lowest common denominator: one thought per sentence, no mental state-keeping required. No human writes first drafts this way.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z." | Staccato drama |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]." | Artificial revelation |
| "He published this. Openly. In a book." | Fragment stacking for emphasis |
| "Platforms do." | Orphaned fragment as punchline |

**Fix:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

## Self-Posed Rhetorical Questions

*Formerly also cataloged as “The X? A Y.” in the retired tropes.md. One tell, one entry now.*

The model asks a question nobody was asking, then answers it for dramatic effect.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "The result? Devastating." | Manufactured suspense |
| "The worst part? Nobody saw it coming." | Same formula |
| "What if [reframe]?" | Socratic posturing |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview |
| "Think about it:" | Condescending prompt |
| "And that's okay." | Unnecessary permission |

**Fix:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## Anaphora Abuse

Repeating the same sentence opening multiple times in quick succession.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "They assume that... They assume that... They assume that..." | Mechanical repetition |
| "They could expose... They could offer... They could provide..." | List disguised as prose |
| "They have built X, but not Y. They have built A, but not B." | Parallel structure stacking |

**Fix:** Vary sentence openings. Combine related points into single sentences.

## Tricolon Abuse

Overuse of the rule-of-three pattern. A single tricolon is fine; multiple back-to-back tricolons are an AI pattern.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Products impress; platforms empower. Products solve; platforms create." | Parallel tricolon stacking |
| "identity, payments, compute, distribution" | Extended lists masquerading as analysis |
| "workflows, decisions, and interactions" | Three-item groupings everywhere |

**Fix:** Use the number the content has. Two things get two; three get three. The habit to break is reaching for three when the content does not supply it, and the tell is a document where every list is exactly three long.

## False Agency

Giving inanimate things human verbs. AI loves this because it avoids naming the actor.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "a complaint becomes a fix" | Someone fixed it. |
| "a bet lives or dies in days" | Someone kills or ships the project. |
| "the decision emerges" | Someone decides. |
| "the culture shifts" | People change behavior. |
| "the conversation moves toward" | Someone steers. |
| "the data tells us" | Someone reads it and draws a conclusion. |
| "the market rewards" | Buyers pay for things. |

**Fix:** Name the human. "The team fixed it that week" beats "the complaint becomes a fix." If no specific person fits, use "you" to put the reader in the seat.

## Narrator-from-a-Distance

Floating above the scene instead of putting the reader in it.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Nobody designed this." | Disembodied observation |
| "This happens because..." | Lecturer voice |
| "This is why..." | Same |
| "People tend to..." | Armchair sociologist |

**Fix:** Put the reader in the room. "You don't sit down one day and decide to..." beats "Nobody designed this."

## Passive Voice

Every sentence needs a subject doing something. Passive voice hides the actor and drains energy.

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "X was created" | Name who created it |
| "It is believed that" | Name who believes it |
| "Mistakes were made" | Name who made them |
| "The decision was reached" | Name who decided |

**Fix:** Find the actor. Put them at the front of the sentence.

## Listicle in a Trench Coat

Numbered or labeled points dressed up as continuous prose. The model writes a listicle but wraps each point in a paragraph starting with "The first... The second... The third..." to disguise the format.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "The first wall is... The second wall is... The third wall is..." | Numbered list pretending to be prose |
| "The second takeaway is... The third takeaway is..." | Same |

**Fix:** If the content is a list, present it as a list. If it should be prose, weave the points together without numbering.

## Superficial Participle Analyses

Tacking a present participle phrase onto the end of a sentence to inject shallow analysis.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "contributing to the region's rich cultural heritage" | Hollow significance-signaling |
| "highlighting its enduring legacy" | Same |
| "underscoring its role as a dynamic hub" | Same |
| "reflecting broader trends in..." | Same |

**Fix:** Either make a specific analytical claim or delete the participle phrase.

## False Ranges

"From X to Y" constructions where X and Y are not on any real scale. In legitimate use, "from X to Y" implies a spectrum with a meaningful middle. AI uses it to list two loosely related things.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "From innovation to implementation to cultural transformation." | No real spectrum |
| "From the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web." | Grandiose range with nothing in between |
| "From problem-solving to scientific discovery to artistic expression." | Fancy list, not a range |

**Fix:** If the items are a list, list them. If there is a real spectrum, describe it.

## Historical Analogy Stacking

Rapid-fire listing of historical companies or tech revolutions to build false authority. Common in technical writing.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Apple didn't build Uber. Facebook didn't build Spotify." | Shotgun historical references |
| "Every major shift -- the web, mobile, social, cloud -- followed..." | Revolution-listing |
| "Take Spotify... Or consider Uber... Airbnb followed... Shopify is another..." | Sequential name-dropping |

**Fix:** Use one example, examine it in depth. One well-analyzed case beats five name-drops.

## "Despite Its Challenges..."

AI acknowledges problems only to immediately dismiss them. Always follows the same beat.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Despite these challenges, the initiative continues to thrive." | Formulaic optimism |
| "Despite its prosperity, [X] faces challenges typical of..." | Structured dismiss-and-pivot |

**Fix:** If challenges are worth mentioning, analyze them. If they are not, skip them.

## Sentence Starters to Avoid

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| A run of sentences opening on What, When, Where, Which, Who, Why, How | The pattern is the repeat, not the word. "When the replica caught up, we cut over" is fine; five of them in a row is a tic. Vary the opener. |
| Paragraphs starting with "So" | Start with content |
| Sentences starting with "Look," | Remove |

Wh- openers become a crutch. "What makes this hard is..." becomes "The constraint is..." or better, name the specific constraint.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template |
| "X that isn't Y" | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |

## Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Three-item lists, compulsively | Use the natural number. A list that happens to have three things is fine; a writer who reaches for three every time is the tell. |
| Questions answered immediately | Let questions breathe or cut them |
| Every paragraph ends punchily | Vary endings |
| Em dashes, dense | Target zero, hard max one per 1,000 words, numeric ranges exempt. A voice sample that uses them overrides this. |
| Staccato fragmentation | Do not stack short punchy sentences |
| "Not always. Not perfectly." | Hedging disguised as reassurance |

## Formatting Tells

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Bold-first bullets | Every list item starting with a bolded keyword is an AI signal |
| Unicode arrows (→) | Use -> or => or plain text instead |
| Smart/curly quotes in a draft | Straight quotes read as typed. Leave them in finished publications and in interface copy, where typesetting is the point; that is craft-review's territory. |
| Signposted conclusions ("In conclusion...") | Let the writing conclude naturally |
| Fractal summaries | Do not summarize what you are about to say, say it, then summarize what you said |

## One-Point Dilution

Making a single argument and restating it in ten different ways. The model pads a simple thesis to feel comprehensive by rephrasing the same idea with different metaphors, examples, and framings.

**Fix:** State the point once, support it, move on. If the piece circles back to the same claim more than twice, cut the repetitions.

## The Dead Metaphor

Latching onto a single metaphor and using it in every paragraph. A human writer introduces a metaphor, uses it, and moves on. AI repeats the same metaphor 5-10 times.

**Fix:** Use a metaphor once or twice. Then drop it.

## Invented Concept Labels

AI clusters invented compound labels that sound analytical without being grounded. It appends abstract problem-nouns (paradox, trap, creep, divide, vacuum, inversion) to domain words and uses them as if they are established terms.

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "the supervision paradox" | Invented term treated as established |
| "the acceleration trap" | Same |
| "workload creep" | Same |

**Fix:** If the concept needs a name, define it. If it does not need a name, describe it in plain language.

## Word Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Lazy extremes (every, always, never, everyone, everybody, nobody) | False authority. Use specifics instead of sweeping claims. |
| All adverbs (-ly words, "really," "just," "literally," "genuinely," "honestly," "simply," "actually") | Empty emphasis. See phrases.md for full list. |

### Content Duplication

Repeating entire sections or paragraphs verbatim within the same piece. This happens when the model loses track of what it has already written, especially in longer pieces. A dead giveaway of unedited AI output. Less common nowadays.

**Avoid patterns like:**
- "The same section appeared twice, word-for-word identical."
- "Paragraph 3 and paragraph 17 are the same sentence reworded"
