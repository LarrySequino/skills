# Tiered AI Vocabulary

Words organized by how reliably they signal AI-generated text. The tiering prevents false positives: a word that's suspicious in a cluster may be perfectly fine alone.

- **Tier 1, always replace.** These appear far more often in AI text than human text (a 5–20x ratio is reported, but its method and data are unpublished).
- **Tier 2, flag in clusters.** Individually fine; two or more in the same paragraph is a strong signal.
- **Tier 3, flag by density or company.** Normal words AI overuses. Flag when the text is saturated with them (roughly 3%+ of total words), or when several land in a paragraph that also carries a Tier 1 or Tier 2 hit. A lone Tier 3 word is never evidence; a short document can stay under the density threshold and still have one badly clustered paragraph.

Replacements are defaults, not mandates. If a flagged word is clearly the right choice in context, keep it.

| overarching | main, central, broad |
| underpinning / underpinnings | basis, foundation, what supports |

## Tier 3: flag only at high density

Normal words. Only flag when the text is saturated with them, a sign that AI filled space with vague praise instead of specifics.

| Word | What to do |
|---|---|
| significant / significantly | Replace some with specifics: numbers, comparisons, examples |
| innovative / innovation | Describe what's actually new |
| effective / effectively | Say how or cite a metric |

| sophisticated | Describe the sophistication |
| instrumental | Say what role it played |
| world-class / state-of-the-art / best-in-class | Cite a benchmark or comparison |

## Tier 3 phrases: flag at repetition or in clusters

Multi-word boilerplate that's individually unobjectionable but stacks heavily in AI content. Flag at 2+ uses of the same phrase, or when three or more *distinct* phrases from this table appear in one piece. That's the shape LLMs take when varying their own boilerplate.

| Phrase | What to do |
|---|---|
| emerging sector / space / category | Name the actual sector or what's emerging |
| the integration of (X with Y) | Describe what's integrated and what changes for the user |
| the intersection of (X and Y) | Pick the specific overlap or cut the framing |
| community-driven | Name what the community does |
| long-term sustainability | Cite the time horizon and the constraint |
| user engagement | Name the action (clicks, comments, retention) |
| designed for long-term [X] | Cut "designed for"; either it is or it isn't |

## Abstract metaphor nouns (technical register)

Words that sound technical and carry less than the plain one. Common in engineering prose, where the fancier noun reads as precision. The tell is that the concrete word is shorter and truer.

| Reach for | Usually means |
|---|---|
| substrate | base |
| wedge (as verb) | add, insert |
| vector | way, route, method |
| nexus, locus | the point where it happens |
| primitive (as noun) | building block |
| harness (as metaphor) | use |
| surface (as in API surface) | what a caller can reach |
| bedrock | the part that does not change |
| scaffolding (as metaphor) | temporary support |
| modality | mode, kind |
| paradigm | approach |
| gold-plating | more than the job needs |
| ratchet (as metaphor) | name the mechanism, or "a limit that only tightens" |
| evacuate (of code) | move out |
| endgame | the last phase |
| north star | the goal |
| flywheel | the loop that compounds |

## Template phrases (avoid)

Slot-fill constructions. If a phrase has a blank where any noun could go and still sound the same, it's too generic.

- "a [adjective] step towards/forward for [noun]" → say what actually changed
- "Whether you're [X] or [Y]" → false breadth meaning "everyone." Pick the audience or cut.
- "I recently had the pleasure of [verb]-ing" → just say what happened: "I talked to," "I read"

## Transition phrases to remove or rewrite

- "Moreover" / "Furthermore" / "Additionally" → restructure so the connection is obvious, or "and," "also"
- "In today's [X]" / "In an era where" → cut or state specific context
- "It's worth noting that" / "Notably" → just state the fact
- "Here's what's interesting / what stood out" → let the content signal its own importance
- "In conclusion" / "In summary" → the conclusion should be obvious
- "When it comes to" → talk about the thing directly
- "At the end of the day" → cut
- "That said" / "That being said" → cut, or "but," "yet," and don't overuse any one of them
