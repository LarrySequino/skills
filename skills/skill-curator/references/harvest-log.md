# Harvest Log Format

The provenance record that makes a maintained skill updatable instead of re-derivable. Lives inside the skill it describes, usually at `references/maintenance.md`, and is read only when the user asks for a refresh.

## Structure

Four parts, in this order.

### 1. Source watchlist

Ranked by signal density, highest first, so a partial pass still covers the sources that matter. For each: URL, one line on what it is good for, and where to look inside it (a changelog, a version-history section, a specific page). Note fetch quirks — a domain that blocks automated access needs a documented workaround so the next pass doesn't rediscover the problem.

Include a line on discovering new sources: what search would surface newcomers, and the instruction to screen them before fetching.

### 2. Harvest criteria

What earns inclusion, stated as conditions rather than aspirations, plus what to reject on sight. Copy the criteria from the curator skill and add anything specific to this skill's domain — especially any hard constraint that new material must never weaken.

### 3. Update procedure

Numbered steps from "copy the installed skill somewhere writable" to "present the packaged file." Include which destination file each kind of harvested item belongs in, any size ceiling on the main file, and the reminder that the agent cannot install the result.

### 4. Log table

| Source | Last checked | Version/state at check |
|---|---|---|
| project-a | 2026-07-28 | 2.9.1 (patterns 1–33; harvested no-fabrication rule) |
| project-b | 2026-07-28 | upstream 3.4.0; local fork already ahead |
| project-c | 2026-07-28 | dormant, single release, skip next pass |
| ad-hoc source | 2026-07-29 | harvested X; rejected flat bans on Y as over-correction |

The version column is what makes the next pass a diff instead of a re-read. Record enough to identify what was seen: a version number, a release tag, a commit count, or a dated description of the state. Record rejections in the same row — future passes will otherwise re-evaluate the same rejected material and reach the same conclusion at full cost.

## Rules

- Update the log in the same pass that harvests, never afterward from memory.
- Record the license status per source as confirmed, asserted, terms, none, or pending, and take text or code only from confirmed; terms means ideas and rewrites ones; ideas written fresh transfer under any of the four, with the overlap scan as the proof.
- If a source can't be verified, write "unverified" rather than a guess.
- Keep dormant sources in the table with a note to skip; removing them means rediscovering them later.
- When a skill is renamed, keep the former name in the log so older references resolve.

## Overlap measurements

A harvest log records ideas taken. It should also record expression measured, because
the two go stale differently: a source can sit unchanged for a year while the skill
drifts into its wording, and only a scan catches that.

Add a row per source with the run count, the longest unbroken run, and where those runs
landed. The location does the interpretive work: hundreds of runs inside a word-list
table mean far less than one long run in a rationale paragraph.

| Source | Scanned | Runs | Longest | Where they sit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| parent-project | 2026-08-20 | 6,169 | 1,189w | SKILL.md, four references | Descent. This is a fork. |
| word-source | 2026-08-20 | 964 | 197w | vocabulary tables only | Weak. Tables converge. |
| idea-source | 2026-08-20 | 48 | 16w | a shared URL, one quoted example | Nothing. Expected. |
| unrelated | 2026-08-20 | 0 | — | — | Clean. |

Record zero results too. A source that shares no phrasing is a fact worth keeping, since
it is the control that makes a high count elsewhere meaningful rather than an artifact of
the method.
