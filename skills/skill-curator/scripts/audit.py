"""Mechanical half of a skill-library audit. Findings, never scores.

Everything here is arithmetic a reader does badly across a library: pairwise
description comparison grows as n squared, line counts drift, a reference link
rots silently. Run it first, then spend the reading on scope, staleness and
whether a skill should exist.
